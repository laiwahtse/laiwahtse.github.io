    <h3>Education</h3>  
    <p>
        My educational experience includes a recently completed PRFE Développeur d'application - Android with OpenClassrooms, which contributed greatly to my development of skills of Java.  New application for Bachelor's-level Diploma for Développeur d'application -Android, which give a chance use html and css to create my resume web site.<br> <br>
        The classes I took and projects I completed were for an application development major, and they imparted many of the concepts necessary to understanding good programming techniques.  I also often worked to complete presentations with classmates, and this helped me hone my ability to collaborate constructively.  <br> <br>
        My educational background has prepared me well for future development and successful career path. I also plan to pursue further coursework in the future in order to keep learning and gain the qualifications to advance in this field. <br>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>

                <dt>Leadership skills</dt>
                <dd>I consider my leadership skills to be one of my greatest strengths. During I  worked in Goldenway as the CEO's personal assistant in the Philippines, I am successfully leading  the Administrative and HR departments in developing new company policies and compensation programs.</dd><br>
                <dt>Communication skills</dt>
                <dd>I was worked big group in past years,  we need to have very good communication skill for communicating with  internal and external parties.
                    In Estee Lauder,  we have 30 members in our department Hong Kong  and  8 department managers in APAC.  The communication is our daily work, so I am used to a bulk of communication per day.</dd><br>
                <dt>Adaptability</dt>

          <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
              <dl>
                  <dt>Delegating</dt>
                  <dd>I often struggle with delegating and choose to take on a larger workload to ensure that a task is completed perfectly. This puts more pressure on myself, so I have been using software to assign tasks and track their completion. So far this has helped me to trust my co-workers and focus more on my own tasks.</dd><br>
                  <dt>Shyness</dt>
                  <dd>Shyness is something that I struggle with in large groups. I find it intimidating to ask questions or raise points, so I have often remained quiet in the past. I have been trying to be more vocal in smaller groups to become more confident</dd><br>
                  <dt>New in programming</dt>
                  <dd>I mainly worked in commercials in my previous position, so I don't have as much experience with Java. I did a course on Java  at OpenClassrooms, but I haven't used it since then. </dd>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
              <dl>
                  <dt>Traveling</dt>
                  <dd>Traveling allows me to adapt to new situations and use my organization and planning skills to ensure I have the most fun I can. I try to anticipate possible delays and other interruptions in my travel and always have a list of important contacts, such as my hotel front desk or travel coordinator. These strategies prepare me for many possible situations, which is how I approach my event and travel planning as an administrative assistant."</dd><br>
                  <dt>Meditation and The Touch of Healing</dt>
                  <dd>One of my hobbies and interests is meditation and The Touch of Healing: Energizing the Body, Mind, and Spirit With Jin Shin Jyutsu. The wellness is a priority of my life . I find that I am better equipped to offer myself self-care. It also keeps me centered and focused, even during high-stress times. </dd><br>
                  <dt>Cooking</dt>
                  <dd>My kitchen is my abode. I have learned to cook from my mother as she is a wonderful cook. I started cooking at the age of 15 and since then I have learned many dishes. Some of the dishes that I’ve made are out of my original recipes. My friends and family praise me a lot of my cooking skills.  I look forward to bond with my office colleagues over some of my tasty-dishes.” </dd>
